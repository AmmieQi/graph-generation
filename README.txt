The file 'Appendix.pdf' is the appendix file for the paper.

The folder "code" contains all the necessary code to reproduce the paper results. We will thoroughly clean up the code and make it public at the time of publication.
All the necessary dependencies are in the "environment.yml" file, managed by Anaconda. To install the dependencies, you may first install Anaconda, then change the last line of "environment.yml" to your conda directory. You can run "conda env create -f environment.yml" to finish the installation.
You may run "python main.py" to start training GraphRNN. Detail arguments are within the "main.py" code.

Thanks!
